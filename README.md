# Using a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
#Overview

This project, developed as part of the AWS AI/ML Scholarship Program Nanodegree – AI Programming with Python, uses advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures — ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG — to classify dog breeds from images.
The goal is to:

Accurately identify whether an image contains a dog.

Determine the specific breed when applicable.

Compare performance across different pretrained models.

This project demonstrates how transfer learning and pre-trained deep learning models can be applied to real-world computer vision tasks.

#About the Project

The program provides detailed code comments and a thoughtfully structured learning path, enabling students to progressively understand image classification, neural network design, and performance evaluation.

The workflow involves:

Loading and preprocessing pet image datasets.

Using pretrained CNN models to extract features.

Comparing classifier predictions against true pet labels.

Evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy and breed identification success rates.
